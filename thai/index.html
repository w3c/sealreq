<h2>Introduction</h2>

<section id="h_about_this_document">
<h3>About this document</h3>

<p>This document outlines some features related to the layout of Thai text used for the Thai language that may be useful background information for those reading the gap-analysis documents and issues for  Thai content authors. It doesn't address the needs of <a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/thai/index.html">other languages</a> that are written in the Thai script.</p>

<p><strong>This document is an initial draft and needs thorough review by Thai experts.</strong></p>
</section>




<section id="h_gap_analysis">
<h3>Gap analysis</h3>

<p>This document is pointed to by a separate document, <a href="../gap-analysis/thai-gap.html">Thai Gap Analysis</a>, which describes gaps in support for Thai on the Web, and prioritises and describes the impact of those gaps on the user.</p>

<p>Wherever an unsupported feature is indentified through the gap analysis process, the requirements for that feature need to be documented. This  document is where those requirements are described.</p>

<p>This document should contain no reference to a particular technology. For example, it should not say &quot;CSS does/doesn't do such and such&quot;, and it should not describe how a technology, such as CSS, should implement the requirements. It is technology agnostic, so that it will be evergreen, and it simply describes how the script works. The gap analysis document is the appropriate place for all kinds of technology-specific information.</p>

<p>The W3C also maintains a tracking system that  has links to github issues in W3C repositories. There are separate links for (a) requests from developers to the user community for information about how scripts/languages work, (b) issues raised against a spec, and (c) browser bugs.  For example, you can find out <a href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=type-info-request">what information developers are currently seeking</a>, and the resulting list can also be filtered by script.</p>

<section id="h_script_overview">
<h2>Thai Script Overview</h2>

<p>The Thai orthography is an <a class="termref" href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/glossary/index.html#abugida">abugida</a>. Consonant letters have an inherent vowel sound. <a class="termref" href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/glossary/index.html#vowelsign">Vowel signs</a> are attached to the consonant to produce a different vowel.</p>




<p>Thai text runs left to right in horizontal lines.</p>

<p>Spaces  separate phrases, rather than words.</p>

<p>Each <a class="termref" href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/glossary/index.html#onset">onset</a> consonant is associated with a high, mid, or low class related to tone. Tone is indicated by a combination of the consonant class, the syllable type (checked/unchecked), plus any tone mark.</p> 

<p>No <a class="termref" href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/glossary/index.html#conjunct">conjuncts</a> are used for consonant clusters.</p>

<p>Syllable-initial clusters and  syllable-final consonant sounds are all written with ordinary consonant letters. It can therefore be difficult to algorithmically detect syllable boundaries.</p>

<p>An <a class="termref" href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/glossary/index.html#inherentvowel">inherent vowel</a> is pronounced <span class="ipa">o</span> inside a closed syllable, and <span class="ipa">a</span> in an open syllable.   Non-inherent vowels are represented using vowel signs. Characters used to represent vowels and dipthongs include combining marks, vowel letters, and consonants. There are <a class="termref" href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/glossary/index.html#prebase">pre-base vowel glyphs</a>. Thai uses visual placement: only the  vowel sign components that appear above or below the consonant are combining marks; the others are ordinary, spacing letters that are <em>typed in the order seen</em>.</p>

<p>There are no <a class="termref" href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/glossary/index.html#independentvowel">independent vowels</a>, and <a class="termref" href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/glossary/index.html#standalonevowel">standalone vowel sounds</a> are written using  vowel signs applied to <span class="codepoint noindex" translate="no"><span lang="th">&#x0E2D;</span> [<span class="uname">U+0E2D THAI CHARACTER O ANG</span>]</span>.</p>

<p>Thai has a large number of <a class="termref" href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/glossary/index.html#compositevowel">composite vowels</a> (including diphthongs) made from  dedicated vowel characters and from consonants. Composite vowels can involve up to 4 glyphs (plus a tone mark), and glyphs can surround the base consonant(s) on up to 3 sides, eg.
<span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="th">เกี๊ยะ</span> <bdi class="ipa">kía̯ʔ</bdi> <bdi class="meaning">geta (footwear)</bdi></span>
</p>

<p>Thai has <a class="termref" href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/glossary/index.html#vocalic">vocalics</a>.</p>

<p>Thai has native digits, and they are commonly used.</p>

<section>
<h2 id="h_text_direction">Text direction</h2>

<p>Thai is written horizontally, left to right.</p>
</section>






<section id="h_shaping">
<h2>Glyph shaping &amp; positioning</h2>
<p>The orthography has no case distinction, and no special transforms are needed to convert between characters. Nor is printed text cursive.</p>





<section id="writing_styles">
<h3>Font styles</h3>
<p>Modern type styles often omit the loops found in more traditional typefaces. See <a href="http://www.fontpad.co.uk/loops-and-latinisation/#more-666">an article</a> that explores this in depth.</p>
<p>Loopless is considered to be more contemporary and modern, and is mainly used for advertising and titling. The distinction doesn’t necessarily map to that of serif vs sans – Noto, for example, provides both serif and sans Thai font faces, but they both have loops.  On the other hand, Neue Frutiger Thai offers traditional (looped) and modern (loopless) alternatives as part of the same font family (each with both regular, italic and bold substyles).</p>

</figure>
</section>




  

<section id="context">
<h3>Context-based shaping &amp; positioning</h3>

<p>Thai has no stacking or conjunct behaviour, but the following are a few  selected  examples of contextual shaping and positioning.</p>

<p>Most of the combining characters in Thai are used for vowel signs and tone marks. Combining characters need to be placed in different positions, according to the visual context. The example below shows the same tone character displayed at different heights, according to what falls beneath it.</p>


<figure id="fig_thai_position" class="sideCaption">
<img src="index-data/thai_position.svg" class="ex" alt="ให้มีขึ้น" data-notes="62px Noto Serif Thai" style="height:5rem;">
<figcaption>The same tone mark displayed at different heights.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Thai regularly combines multiple combining characters above a base consonant. There are two examples in the text below, both of which show a base character with a vowel sign and then a tone mark on top.</p>


<figure id="fig_multiple_diacritics" class="sideCaption">
<img src="index-data/fig_multiple_diacritics.svg" class="ex" alt="ครั้งที่" data-notes="62px Noto Serif Thai" style="height:5rem;">
<figcaption>Multiple diacritics (vowel sign + tone mark) attached to the same base character.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Although Thai has very little in the way of shaping, [[[#fig_shaping]]] shows a number of small glyph adaptations that occur in some fonts (here, Noto Serif Thai) when certain tall or deep consonant letters have vowel marks attached. The  2 examples on the left show a slight reduction in the downward extent of the consonant glyph; in the middle 2 examples the part of the consonant glyph that lies below the baseline is removed altogether and replaced by the vowel sign; and in the right-most example, the height of the consonant glyph is reduced when a vowel sign appears above it.</p>

</div>
<figcaption>Shaping changes in the Noto Serif Thai font. Each example shows an unadorned consonant glyph on the left, and on the right a shaped version when a vowel sign is attached.</figcaption>
</figure>

</section>





<section id="fontstyle">
<h3>Font styling &amp; weight</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.fontpad.co.uk/thai-italics-1/">Mitchell</a> describes how italicisation is used for meta text and to convey the ‘about’ voice, rather than for emphasis or names of things (for which  bold is used).</p>
<p>Italicisation tends to be applied to whole paragraphs or groups of paragraphs, for such things as picture captions, bylines, and other labels, commentaries, summaries such as standfirsts in magazines or news stories, and signposting. It is also regularly used for direct speech between quote marks.</p>
</section>
</section>






<section id="graphemes">
<h2>Graphemes</h2>  

<p id="def-grapheme" class="explanatoryintro definitionStub">A <a class="termref" target="_blank" href="../glossary/index.html#grapheme">grapheme</a> is a user-perceived unit of text. Text operations that use graphemes as a unit of text include line-breaking, forwards deletion, cursor movement &amp; selection, character counts, text spacing, text insertion, justification, case conversions, and sorting.  The Unicode Standard uses generalised rules to define '<a class="termref" target="_blank" href="../glossary/index.html#graphemecluster">grapheme clusters</a>', which approximate the likely grapheme boundaries in a writing system, however they don't work well with many complex scripts.</p>
 
<p>Non-combining Thai vowel characters are treated as independent grapheme clusters. Only combining characters are grouped together with their base into a cluster.</p>





<section id="graphemeC">
<h3>Grapheme clusters</h3>

<!--figure id="fig_grapheme_boundaries">
<img src="index-data/grapheme_boundaries.png" class="ex" alt="และที่จะกลับ" data-notes="58px Noto Serif Thai">
<figcaption>Grapheme cluster boundaries split spacing vowel signs from their base consonants, but not combining characters.</figcaption>
</figure-->

<p><code>Base SARA_AM? Combining_mark*</code></p>

<p>Combining marks may include zero or more of the following types of character, grouped by labels that correspond to Unicode Indic syllabic category values.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/apps/listindic/index.html?chars=ิีึืุู็ัำ">Dependent vowels</a> [9] (see <a class="secref" href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/thai/th.html#combiningvowels">Combining marks used for vowels</a>)  Thai has many composite vowels that are made of combinations of ordinary letter  characters and  combining marks clustered around a base, but in the modern Thai language only one of these dependent vowels is used per base. (Other languages may use more than one. The letter characters are ordinary spacing characters, that are manually positioned in the text stream.)</li>

<li><a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/apps/listindic/index.html?chars=่้๊๋">Tone marks</a> [4] (see <a class="secref" href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/thai/th.html#tones">Tones</a>) Tone marks should be typed and stored immediately after a dependent vowel, if there is one, and immediately after the base otherwise.</li>

<li><a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/apps/listindic/index.html?chars=์">Consonant killer</a> (<span class="name">májtʰantʰákʰâːt</span>) [1] (see <a class="secref" href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/thai/th.html#novowel">Consonants with no following vowel</a>) Used after other elements in the grapheme cluster to indicate cancelling of a consonant or syllable.</li>
</ol>

<p>The spacing letters used for vowel signs are all individual grapheme clusters, with the exception of &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="codepoint" translate="no"><bdi lang="th">ำ</bdi> [<span class="uname">U+0E33 THAI CHARACTER SARA AM</span>]</span> (see <a class="secref" href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/thai/th.html#nikhahit">Sara AM &amp; nikhahit</a>), which has the general category of Letter, but it is treated like a combining mark during segmentation.</p>

<p>The following examples show a variety of grapheme clusters:</p>


<table class="noBorderTable alignStartTable" style="margin-inline-start: 10%;">
<tr><td><img src="index-data/g_smell.svg" alt="" style="height:4rem;"></td><td><span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="th">ได้กลิ่น</span> <bdi class="trans">dây.klìn</bdi> <bdi class="meaning">to smell</bdi></span></td></tr>

<tr><td><img src="index-data/g_toilet.svg" alt="" style="height:4rem;"></td><td><span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="th">ห้องน้ำ</span> <bdi class="ipa">hɔ̂ŋ.náːm</bdi> <bdi class="meaning">toilet</bdi></span></td></tr>

<tr><td><img src="index-data/g_program.svg" alt="" style="height:3.5rem;"></td><td><span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="th">โปรแกรม</span> <bdi class="ipa">prōː.krɛ̄m</bdi> <bdi class="meaning">(computer) program</bdi></span></td></tr>

<tr><td><img src="index-data/g_sacred.svg" alt="" style="height:4rem;"></td><td><span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="th">ศักดิ์สิทธิ์</span> <bdi class="ipa">sàk̚.sìt̚</bdi> <bdi class="meaning">to be sacred</bdi></span></td></tr>
</table>


<p>The grapheme cluster boundaries are convenient for justification algorithms, which  insert equal amounts of space between non-combining letters, including between non-combining vowel sign components and their consonants (see <a class="secref" href="#justification">Text alignment &amp; justification</a>).</p>

<p>One exception is the aforementioned <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><bdi lang="th">ำ</bdi> [<span class="uname">U+0E33 THAI CHARACTER SARA AM</span>]</span>, which is split across 2 typographic units for the purpose of justification (see [[[#inter_character_spacing]]]).</p>

<section id="h_characters_and_phrases">
<h2>Structural boundaries &amp; markers</h2>


<section id="h_words">
<h3>Word boundaries</h3>
<p>The concept of 'word' is difficult to define in any language (see <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/articles/typography/linebreak.en#whatisword">What is a word?</a>). We will  treat it as a vaguely-defined but recognisable semantic unit that is typically smaller than a phrase and may comprise one or more syllables.</p>
<p>Spaces are used in Thai as phrase separators, but Thai doesn't separate words in a phrase using visible spaces.</p>
<p>There is, however, a concept of words in the text. For example, lines are supposed to be broken at word boundaries.</p>
<figure>
<img src="index-data/thai_words.png" class="ex" alt="รวมทั้งวิทยาการด้านคอมพิว" data-alt="รวม​ทั้ง​วิทยาการ​ด้าน​คอมพิว" data-notes="56px Noto Serif Thai">
<figcaption>Word boundaries occur where the vertical lines appear, though they are not marked by the script.</figcaption>
</figure>




<section id="h_wordBoundary">
<h4>Word boundary detection</h4>

<p>The main difficulty arises when dealing with compound words. It can often be difficult to decide whether a given string of syllables represents multiple words or a single compound word.</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="index-data/thai_alt1.png" class="ex" alt="ตัวอย่างการเขียนกาษาไทย" data-alt="ตัวอย่าง​การเขียน​กาษาไทย" data-notes="42px Noto Serif Thai"></p>
<p><img src="index-data/thai_alt2.png" class="ex" alt="ตัวอย่างการเขียนกาษาไทย" data-alt="ตัวอย่าง​การ​เขียน​กาษาไทย" data-notes="42px Noto Serif Thai"></p>
<figcaption>Alternative line break opportunities for Thai text using compound nouns.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The variation may be related to the operation being performed on the text (eg. line breaking in narrow newsprint columns, vs. double-click selection, vs. cursor movement, etc.), or it may just   be down to personal preference,</p>
<p>The  difference may also be contextually dependent. Wirote Aroonmanakun describes how <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="th">คนขับรถ</span> <span class="ipa">kʰon kʰàp ròt</span> <span class="meaning">driver</span></span> should be viewed as a single word in the context <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="th">คนขับรถนั่งคอยอยู่ในรถ</span> <span class="ipa">kʰon kʰàp ròt nâŋ kʰɔːj jûː nràjt</span> <span class="meaning">the (man who works as a) driver is waiting in the car</span></span>, whereas in the phrase <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="th">คนขับรถผ่านแยกนี้ไม่มากนัก</span> <span class="ipa">kʰon kʰàp ròt pʰàːn jɛ̀ːk níː mâj màːk nàk</span> <span class="meaning">not many people drive through this intersection</span></span> it would be viewed as 3 words, referring to anyone who is driving. <sup><a href="http://pioneer.netserv.chula.ac.th/~awirote/ling/snlp2007-wirote.pdf">a</a></sup></p>
<p>Proper names, which are composed from multiple words, are also problematic, especially because there are no capital letters to distinguish them from other pieces of text.</p>
</section>


<section id="h_zwsp">
<h4>Zero-width space (ZWSP) &amp; Word-joiner (WJ)</h4>

<p>In order to manually fine-tune word-boundary detection, the  invisible character <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span class="uname">U+200B ZERO WIDTH SPACE</span></span> (ZWSP) can  be  used  to  create  breaks.</p>
<p>To prevent a break between syllables, <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span class="uname">U+2060 WORD JOINER</span></span> (WJ) can be used.</p>
<p>It is also important to bear in mind that Thai may be used to write various languages, in particular minority languages for which different dictionaries are needed. Since such dictionaries may not available in a given browser or other application, there is a tendency to use ZWSP in order to compensate.</p>
<p>Large-scale manual entry of ZWSP and WJ has potential downsides because the user cannot see them; this leads to problems with ZWSP being inserted in the wrong position, or multiple times. However, these don't set a state, so it doesn't create major issues. It would be useful, however, if an editor showed the location of these characters.</p>
<p>Care should also be taken when trying to match text, eg. for searching in a page. WJ should be ignored. ZWSP may or may not be ignored, depending on whether word boundaries are significant for the search.</p>
</section>







<section id="syllableParsing">
<h4>Parsing syllables</h4>

<p>Automatically adding spaces (zero-width or other) around Thai syllables is problematic because syllable-final consonants are not easy to identify. Thai segmentation may have to deal with ambiguous situations. Take for example the word
<span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="th">ถนน</span> <bdi class="trans">thànǒn</bdi> <bdi class="ipa">tʰà.nǒn</bdi> <bdi class="meaning">road</bdi></span>
</p>

<p>Because syllable-final sounds are ordinary letters, with no special indication, this could be parsed as <span class="ipa">ta.non</span>, <span class="ipa">ton.na</span>, or even <span class="ipa">ta.na.na</span>, and indeed some words are written the same but pronounced differently, eg.
<span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="th">นม</span> <bdi class="ipa">nōm / nama</bdi> <bdi class="meaning">milk / a salutation</bdi></span>
</p>

<p>Similarly, because medial consonants are written with normal characters, there is a possibile ambiguity about whether a sequence contains an inherent vowel, eg.
<span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="th">กรี</span> <bdi class="ipa">kà.rīː / krīː</bdi> <bdi class="meaning">elephant / pointy bit on shrimp head</bdi></span>
</p>
</section>

</section>






<section id="abbrev">
<h3>Abbreviation, ellipsis &amp; repetition</h3>

<section id="repetition">
<h4>Repetition</h4>

<p><span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="th">ๆ</span> [<span class="uname">U+0E46 THAI CHARACTER MAIYAMOK</span>]</span> is used to mark repetition of preceding letters. It is typically preceded and followed by a space, eg. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="th">ทุกวัน ๆ</span> <bdi class="ipa">tʰùk.wan tʰùkwan</bdi> <bdi class="meaning">everyday</bdi></span> However, some publishers prefer to publish without a leading space, ie. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="th">ทุกวันๆ</span></span></p>

<p>This character shouldn't be wrapped to the beginning of a new line on its own, and should be kept not far from the preceding text that it duplicates during justification.</p>
</section>




<section id="abbreviation">
<h4>Abbreviation</h4>

<p><span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="th">ฯ</span> [<span class="uname">U+0E2F THAI CHARACTER PAIYANNOI</span>]</span> is used to indicate elision or abbreviation of letters; it  is    viewed  as  a  kind  of  letter,  however,  and  is  used  with  considerable  frequency because of its appearance in such words as the Thai name for Bangkok, <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="th">กรุงเทพฯ</span> <span class="trans">k̯ṟuŋ̱eṯʰp̱ʰ⋯</span> <span class="ipa">krūŋ tʰêːp</span></span> which is short for <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="th">กรุงเทพมหานคร</span> <span class="trans">k̯ṟuŋ̱eṯʰp̱ʰm̱hāṉḵʰṟ</span> <span class="ipa">krūŋ tʰêːp mahǎː nákʰɔ̄ːn</span></span>It is followed by a space.</p>
</section>




<section id="ellipsis">
<h4>Ellipsis</h4>

<h2>Line &amp; paragraph layout</h2>



<section id="linebreak">
<h3>Line breaking &amp; hyphenation</h3>

<p>Even where Thai doesn't indicate word boundaries, when Thai text is wrapped at the end of a line it should break at word boundaries. </p>
<p>As  the width of a browser window changes, the text in [[[#fig_thai_wrap]]] should break at the  points shown if the browser supports Thai wrapping:</p>

<figure id="fig_thai_wrap">
<img src="index-data/thai_wrap.png" class="ex" alt="โลกจะใช้เพียง" data-notes="62px Noto Serif Thai">
<figcaption>Break points detected in a sequence of Thai characters by an automatic word segmenter.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Because Thai doesn't separate words,  applications typically look up   word boundaries in a dictionary, however, such lookup doesn't always produce the needed result, especially when dealing with compound words and proper names (see [[[#h_words]]]). For more details, see [[[#h_wordBoundary]]]. </p>

<p>To counteract these deficiencies, authors may use <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span class="uname">U+200B ZERO WIDTH SPACE</span></span> and <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span class="uname">U+2060 WORD JOINER</span></span>  (see [[[#h_zwsp]]]).</p>

<p>Note that most browsers have heuristics for segmenting Thai text, but there is no guarantee that these rules will work equally well for <a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/thai/index.html#languages">other languages that are written in the Thai script</a>.</p>
<section id="linedge">
<h4>Line-edge rules</h4>

<p>As in almost all writing systems, certain punctuation characters should not appear at the end or the start of a line. The Unicode line-break properties help applications decide whether a character should appear at the start or end of a line.</p>

<p>The following list gives examples of typical behaviours for characters used in modern Thai. Context may affect the behaviour of some of these and other characters.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="ex list" lang="th">“ ‘ (</span> &nbsp; should not be the last character on a line</li>
<li><span class="ex list" lang="th">” ’ ) ? ! ๚ ๛ %</span> &nbsp; should not begin a new line</li>
<li><span class="ex list" lang="th">฿</span> &nbsp; should be kept with any number, even if separated by a space or parenthesis.</li>
</ul>

<!--p>The following characters should <em>not</em> produce a line-break when they appear inside or alongside a word: <span class="charExample inline list" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="hy">ʼ ՛ ՜ ՝ ՞ ՟</span></span>.</p-->

<p>The repetition character, 
<span class="codepoint" translate="no"><bdi lang="th">&#x0E46;</bdi> [<span class="uname">U+0E46 THAI CHARACTER MAIYAMOK</span>]</span>
is always preceded by space, however it should not wrap to the next line on its own.</p>

<section id="justification">
<h3>Text alignment &amp; justification</h3>

<p>Justification in Thai primarily adjusts the blank spaces between phrases, rather than expanding the text between words or syllables. The fact that lines break at word boundaries helps reduce the size of the gaps produced.</p>
<p>Thai may also make certain adjustments to inter-character spacing. The character-based spacing is most common in narrow columns, such as newsprint, where there is no space except at the end of a line.</p>
<p>Any <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span class="uname">U+200B ZERO WIDTH SPACE</span></span> (ZWSP) is used to separate words is ignored during  justification. Justification proceeds as if it wasn't there.</p>




<section id="inter_character_spacing">
<h4>Inter-character spacing</h4>

<p>The justification in [[[#fig_justification_intercharacter_spacing]]] shows equal spacing across a phrase where there are no space characters to stretch. Note how the equal spacing separates pre-base and post-base vowel sign components from their consonants by the same amount as consonants are separated from each other; they are not kept together with the base consonant they modify.</p>

<figure id="fig_justification_intercharacter_spacing">
<img alt="แนะโบรกฯรวมตัวตั้งสนง.ตปท." src="index-data/justification_intercharacter_spacing.jpg" data-source="" >
<figcaption>A line with no spaces applies inter-character spacing to justify the text.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This kind of spacing requires a special behaviour for <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="th">&#x0E33;</span> [<span class="uname">U+0E33 THAI CHARACTER SARA AM</span>]</span>. The small circle is kept with the preceding consonant, and space is added before the spacing part of the vowel, as shown in [[[#fig_am_spacing]]].</p>


<figure id="fig_am_spacing">
<img src="index-data/am_spacing.svg" class="ex" alt="น้ำ นํ้า" data-notes="62px Noto Serif Thai" style="height: 6rem;">
<figcaption>Sara AM before (left) and after (right) inter-character spacing has been applied.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>(To facilitate this, applications tend to convert <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="th">&#x0E33;</span> [<span class="uname">U+0E33 THAI CHARACTER SARA AM</span>]</span> to the sequence <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="th">&#x0E4D;&#x0E32;</span> [<span class="uname">U+0E4D THAI CHARACTER NIKHAHIT</span> + <span class="uname">U+0E32 THAI CHARACTER SARA AA</span>]</span> before stretching. Some care has to also be taken to correctly order the superscript glyphs, since in memory the tone mark precedes the nikhahit. The <span class="name">nikhahit</span> character is not otherwise used for modern Thai.)</p>

<h4>Paragraph indentation</h4>

<section id="baselines">
<h3>Baselines, line height, etc.</h3>

<p>Thai uses the so-called 'alphabetic' baseline, which is the same as for Latin and many other scripts.</p>

<p>Thai places vowel and tone marks above base characters, one above the other, and can also add combining characters below the line. The complexity of these marks means that the vertical resolution needed for clearly readable Thai text is higher than for, say, Latin text. In addition.</p>

<p>To give an approximate idea, [[[#fig_baselines]]] compares Latin and Thai glyphs from Noto  fonts. The basic height of Thai letters in this font is typically around the Latin x-height, however extenders and combining marks reach well beyond the Latin ascenders and descenders, creating a need for larger line spacing. In other fonts, the basic height of the Thai letters tends to between the Latin x-height and cap-height, and the overall height of the Thai line is therefore greater. See for example the Angsana New font sample below.</p>
