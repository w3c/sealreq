# Southeast Asian Layout task force

This group exists to allow a network of experts to share information about gaps and requirements for support of Southeast Asian scripts on the Web and in eBooks. 

The main problem we seem to face at the moment is that experts don't know how to tell the W3C what problems exist for support of their script on the Web, and the W3C doesn't know how to contact people who can help when questions arise. This network of experts should help to significantly reduce that problem. 

Some experts may go a step further, and contribute to a gap-analysis or requirements document for a given script.

Topics for discussion are suggested by [the gap-analysis template](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/templates/gap-analysis/gap-analysis_template.html). This work supports the development of the [matrix]() indicating hot-spots for language support.

### Documents

### Feedback
Please use the [GitHub issue list](https://github.com/w3c/sealreq/issues) for discussions and to report issues.

### Following
Rather than just 'Watch' this repository, it is best to subscribe to the [public-i18n-sea](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-sea/) mailing list. That list is notified once a day (in digest form) about changes to this repository, but also about other W3C Working Group issues related to Southeast Asian writing systems. (Please use github issues rather than the mailing list to send feedback.)

You can find a list of open issues, including those from Working Groups, on the [Layout Tracker](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=seasia) page. (That link applies a seasia filter.)

### Contributing
All contributors should read and agree with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Group _members_ are expert contributors who provide advice on requirements and gaps for the script they are familiar with. Some may also participate actively in producing the work of the group, contributing text and advice to create the outputs, and participating in meetings. For more information about becoming a group member contact [Richard Ishida](mailto:ishida@w3.org). We welcome participation requests.
