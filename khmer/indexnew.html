<h3>About this document</h3>

<p>The aim of this document is to describe the basic requirements for Khmer script layout and text support on the Web and in eBooks. These requirements provide information for Web technologies such as CSS, HTML and digital publications, and for application developers, about how to support users of the Khmer script. The document currently focuses on texts using the Cambodian language.</p>

<p>In the absence of content authored specifically for this document, the sections in the document point to information that exists elsewhere for a given topic.  The document focuses on typographic layout issues.  For a deeper understanding of the Khmer script itself and how it works see <cite>Cambodian (Khmer) Orthography Notes</cite>, which includes topics such as: <a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/khmr/km.html#phonology">Phonology</a>, <a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/khmr/km.html#vowels">Vowels</a>, <a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/khmr/km.html#vocalics">Vocalics</a>, <a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/khmr/km.html#consonants">Consonants</a>, <a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/khmr/km.html#encoding">Encoding choices</a>, and <a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/khmr/km.html#numbers">Numbers</a>.</p>

<section id="h_gap_analysis">
<h3>Gap analysis</h3>

<p>This document is pointed to by a separate document, <a href="../gap-analysis/khmer-gap.html"><cite>Khmer Gap Analysis</cite></a>, which describes gaps in support for Khmer on the Web, and prioritises and describes the impact of those gaps on the user.</p>
<p>Wherever an unsupported feature is indentified through the gap analysis process, the requirements for that feature need to be documented. This document is where those requirements are described.</p>
<p>This document should contain no reference to a particular technology. For example, it should not say &quot;CSS does/doesn't do such and such&quot;, and it should not describe how a technology, such as CSS, should implement the requirements. It is technology agnostic, so that it will be evergreen, and it simply describes how the script works. The gap analysis document is the appropriate place for all kinds of technology-specific information.</p>

<section id="h_script_overview">
<h2>Khmer Script Overview</h2>

<p>The script is an <span class="newterm"><a class="termref" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/i18n-glossary/#dfn-abugida">abugida</a></span>, ie. like most Brahmi-influenced scripts, each consonant carries with it an inherent vowel. The sound following a consonant can be modified by attaching vowel signs to the consonant when writing.</p>


<p>Khmer text runs left to right in horizontal lines. Words are not separated by spaces, however words may be separated by zero-width space characters (ZWSP). Spaces are used as phrase separators.</p>

<p>The orthography is based around, and segmented into, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/i18n-glossary/#dfn-othographic-syllable" class="termref">orthographic syllables</a>, which may not match phonological syllables directly.</p>

<p>A key feature of Khmer is that there are a large number of vowel sounds, and only a few vowel signs; and there are a large number of consonant letters for only a small number of consonant sounds. This led to a system where there are generally two consonant signs for a given sound, each belonging to one of two classes (or registers). So to determine the pronunciation of an inherent vowel or a vowel sign one first determines which class of consonant it follows. For example, using the two symbols for the sound <span class="ipa">k</span>, <span class="ex" lang="km">ក</span> is <span class="ipa">kɑː</span> <span class="meaning">neck</span>, and <span class="ex" lang="km">គ</span> is <span class="ipa">kɔː</span> <span class="meaning">mute</span>. Other factors may also affect the sound, such as stress, vowel harmony, and diacritics.</p>

<p>Clusters of consonant letters are very common at the beginning of a word, but such clusters also occur medially in multisyllable words, and occasionally at the end of a word (though the second consonant at the word end is usually not pronounced). Clusters are indicated by stacked consonants. Subjoined forms are created using an invisible <em class="foreign">coeng</em> character. Stacks do not span word boundaries.</p>

<p>Word-final consonant sounds (typically 8 consonants and characters) use ordinary code points without an inherent vowel. Because there are no spaces or other word dividers, it is difficult to detect boundaries algorithmically. Two word-final sounds (<span class="ipa">m</span> and <span class="ipa">h</span>) can be produced using combining marks.</p>

<p>Khmer has <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/i18n-glossary/#dfn-pre-base" class="termref">pre-base glyphs</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/i18n-glossary/#dfn-circumgraph" class="termref">circumgraphs</a>, 2 of which can decompose into multipart vowels. It also has a good number of multipart vowels (made from combinations of vowel signs, and consonants/diacritics). Multipart vowels can involve up to 3 glyphs, but only surround the base consonant(s) on 2 sides.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/i18n-glossary/#dfn-standalone-vowel" class="termref">Standalone vowel</a> sounds are typically written using vowel signs applied to <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="km">អ</span> <span class="uname">U+17A2 KHMER LETTER QA</span></span>, but there is also an incomplete set of <a class="termref" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/i18n-glossary/#dfn-independent-vowel">independent vowels</a>.</p>

<h3>Text alignment &amp; justification</h3>

<p>Justification in Khmer adjusts blank spaces, but also makes certain adjustments to inter-character spacing.</p>
</section>







<section id="h_spacing">
<h3>Text spacing</h3>
<p>Cambodian text doesn't appear to use inter-letter spacing in running text, however it is sometimes used in signage. (<a href="https://github.com/w3c/sealreq/issues/9#issuecomment-387971659">@mcdurdin)</a> See an <a href="https://www.phnompenhpost.com/post-property/impasse-tbong-khmum-over-who-starts-building-first">example</a>.</p>
<p>The rules for where the separations appear are still not clear, however one might expect that it keeps together base + subjoined consonants, and base consonants + vowel signs.</p>
<p>The situation is less clear for spacing vowel-signs such as <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="km">◌ា</span> [<span class="uname">U+17B6 KHMER VOWEL SIGN AA​</span>]</span>, which are shown separated in the example linked to above.</p>
