<h3>About this document</h3>

<p>The aim of this document is to describe the basic requirements for Khmer script layout and text support on the Web and in eBooks. These requirements provide information for Web technologies such as CSS, HTML and digital publications, and for application developers, about how to support users of the Khmer script. The document currently focuses on texts using the Cambodian language.</p>

<p>In the absence of content authored specifically for this document, the sections in the document point to information that exists elsewhere for a given topic.  The document focuses on typographic layout issues.  For a deeper understanding of the Khmer script itself and how it works see <cite>Cambodian (Khmer) Orthography Notes</cite>, which includes topics such as: <a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/khmr/km.html#phonology">Phonology</a>, <a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/khmr/km.html#vowels">Vowels</a>, <a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/khmr/km.html#vocalics">Vocalics</a>, <a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/khmr/km.html#consonants">Consonants</a>, <a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/khmr/km.html#encoding">Encoding choices</a>, and <a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/khmr/km.html#numbers">Numbers</a>.</p>

<h3>Gap analysis</h3>

<p>This document is pointed to by a separate document, <a href="../gap-analysis/khmer-gap.html"><cite>Khmer Gap Analysis</cite></a>, which describes gaps in support for Khmer on the Web, and prioritises and describes the impact of those gaps on the user.</p>
<p>Wherever an unsupported feature is indentified through the gap analysis process, the requirements for that feature need to be documented. This document is where those requirements are described.</p>
<p>This document should contain no reference to a particular technology. For example, it should not say &quot;CSS does/doesn't do such and such&quot;, and it should not describe how a technology, such as CSS, should implement the requirements. It is technology agnostic, so that it will be evergreen, and it simply describes how the script works. The gap analysis document is the appropriate place for all kinds of technology-specific information.</p>

<section id="h_script_overview">
<h2>Khmer Script Overview</h2>

<p>The script is an <span class="newterm"><a class="termref" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/i18n-glossary/#dfn-abugida">abugida</a></span>, ie. like most Brahmi-influenced scripts, each consonant carries with it an inherent vowel. The sound following a consonant can be modified by attaching vowel signs to the consonant when writing.</p>


<p>Khmer text runs left to right in horizontal lines. Words are not separated by spaces, however words may be separated by zero-width space characters (ZWSP). Spaces are used as phrase separators.</p>

<p>The orthography is based around, and segmented into, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/i18n-glossary/#dfn-othographic-syllable" class="termref">orthographic syllables</a>, which may not match phonological syllables directly.</p>

<p>A key feature of Khmer is that there are a large number of vowel sounds, and only a few vowel signs; and there are a large number of consonant letters for only a small number of consonant sounds. This led to a system where there are generally two consonant signs for a given sound, each belonging to one of two classes (or registers). So to determine the pronunciation of an inherent vowel or a vowel sign one first determines which class of consonant it follows. For example, using the two symbols for the sound <span class="ipa">k</span>, <span class="ex" lang="km">ក</span> is <span class="ipa">kɑː</span> <span class="meaning">neck</span>, and <span class="ex" lang="km">គ</span> is <span class="ipa">kɔː</span> <span class="meaning">mute</span>. Other factors may also affect the sound, such as stress, vowel harmony, and diacritics.</p>

<p>Clusters of consonant letters are very common at the beginning of a word, but such clusters also occur medially in multisyllable words, and occasionally at the end of a word (though the second consonant at the word end is usually not pronounced). Clusters are indicated by stacked consonants. Subjoined forms are created using an invisible <em class="foreign">coeng</em> character. Stacks do not span word boundaries.</p>

<p>Word-final consonant sounds (typically 8 consonants and characters) use ordinary code points without an inherent vowel. Because there are no spaces or other word dividers, it is difficult to detect boundaries algorithmically. Two word-final sounds (<span class="ipa">m</span> and <span class="ipa">h</span>) can be produced using combining marks.</p>

<p>Khmer has <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/i18n-glossary/#dfn-pre-base" class="termref">pre-base glyphs</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/i18n-glossary/#dfn-circumgraph" class="termref">circumgraphs</a>, 2 of which can decompose into multipart vowels. It also has a good number of multipart vowels (made from combinations of vowel signs, and consonants/diacritics). Multipart vowels can involve up to 3 glyphs, but only surround the base consonant(s) on 2 sides.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/i18n-glossary/#dfn-standalone-vowel" class="termref">Standalone vowel</a> sounds are typically written using vowel signs applied to <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="km">អ</span> <span class="uname">U+17A2 KHMER LETTER QA</span></span>, but there is also an incomplete set of <a class="termref" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/i18n-glossary/#dfn-independent-vowel">independent vowels</a>.</p>

<h3>Font styles</h3>

<p>There are several distinct styles of font in Modern Khmer.</p>
<p>Most modern typefaces are set in an upright style (called <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="km">អក្សរឈរ</span> <span class="trans">ʔɑːksɑː cʰɔː</span></span> or <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="km">អក្សរត្រង់</span> <span class="trans">ʔɑːksɑː trɑŋ</span></span>).<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_alphabet#Styles">w</a></sup> This is the style used for this page.</p>
<figure>
<p class="ex large" lang="km"><img src="images/font_style_chor.png" alt=""></p>
   <figcaption>The text <span class="ex" lang="km">អក្សរខ្មែ</span> in an âksâr chôr font style.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The slanted style (<span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="km">អក្សរជ្រៀង</span> <span class="trans">ʔɑːksɑː criəŋ</span></span>) is used for whole documents or novels. The oblique styling has no affect on the semantics of the text.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_alphabet#Styles">w</a></sup></p>

<p class="ex large" lang="km"><img src="images/font_style_chrieng.png" alt=""></p>
   <figcaption>The text <span class="ex" lang="km">អក្សរខ្មែ</span> in an âksâr chriĕng font style.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The round style (<span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="km">អក្សរមូល</span> <span class="trans">ʔɑːksɑː muːl</span></span>) includes more ligated forms, and is used for titles and headings in Cambodian documents, books, or currency, as well as on shop signs or banners. It may also be used to emphasise important names or nouns.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_alphabet#Styles">w</a></sup></p>

</figure>

<p>Another style (<span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="km">អក្សរខម</span> <span class="trans">ʔɑːksɑː kʰɑːm</span></span>), characterized by sharper serifs and angles and retainment of some antique characteristics, is used for yantra text in Cambodia as well as in Thailand.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_alphabet#Styles">w</a></sup></p>

<section id="h_characters_and_phrases">
<h2>Punctuation &amp; inline features</h2>


<section id="h_words">
<h3>Word boundaries</h3>

<p>The concept of 'word' is difficult to define in any language (see <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/articles/typography/linebreak.en#whatisword">What is a word?</a>). We will treat it as a vaguely-defined but recognisable semantic unit that is typically smaller than a phrase and may comprise one or more syllables.</p>

<p>Spaces are used in Khmer as phrase separators, but Khmer doesn't separate words in a phrase using visible spaces.</p>

<p>Although Khmer doesn't use spaces or dividers between words, the expectation is that line-breaks occur at word boundaries.</p>

<p>There are three basic types of Khmer word:</p>


<ol>
<li>Single, indivisible words: eg. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="km">ជាតិ</span> <span class="trans">c̱āti</span> <span class="meaning">national</span></span>, <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="km">វិទ្យាល័យ</span> <span class="trans">v̱iṯ͓ȳāḻăȳ</span> <span class="meaning">highschool</span></span>, <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="km">កម្ម</span> <span class="trans">km̱͓m̱</span> <span class="meaning">mission</span></span>.</li>

<li>Words with prefixes and suffixes: eg. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="km">អន្តរជាតិ</span> <span class="trans">ʔṉ͓tṟc̱āti</span> <span class="meaning">international</span></span>, <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="km">មហវិទ្យាល័យ</span> <span class="trans">m̱hv̱iṯ͓ȳāḻăȳ</span> <span class="meaning">high school</span></span> and <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="km">កម្មករ</span> <span class="trans">km̱͓m̱kṟ</span> <span class="meaning">workers</span></span>.</li>

<li>Compound words (combining 2, 3, or more single words): eg. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="km">ជាតិសាសន៍</span> <span class="trans">c̱ātisāsṉ˟</span> <span class="meaning">race</span></span>, <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="km">កម្មផល</span> <span class="trans">km̱͓m̱pʰḻ</span> <span class="meaning">karma</span></span>, <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="km">សកលវិទ្យាល័យ</span> <span class="trans">skḻv̱iṯ͓ȳāḻăȳ</span> <span class="meaning">university</span></span>.</li>
</ol>


<p>The first two types cannot be broken, but the third type can. For example, <span class="ex" lang="km">|ជាតិ|សាសន៍|</span>, <span class="ex" lang="km">|កម្ម|ផល|</span>, and <span class="ex" lang="km">|សកល|វិទ្យាល័យ|</span>. (<a href="https://github.com/w3c/sealreq/issues/4#issuecomment-384981313">Hong</a>)</p>

<p>Text is not broken at sub-word syllable boundaries. In fact, this is particularly difficult to do algorithmically in Khmer, because syllable-final consonants are indistinguishable from consonants with an inherent vowel that constitute a new syllable. Some kind of morphological analysis is needed.</p>
</section>





<section id="h_zwsp">
<h3>Zero-width space (ZWSP) &amp; Word-joiner (WJ)</h3>

<p>In order to manually fine-tune word-boundary detection, the invisible character <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span class="uname">U+200B ZERO WIDTH SPACE</span></span> (ZWSP) can be used to create breaks. <sup><a href="https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode11.0.0/ch16.pdf#G53337">u625</a></sup></p>

<p>To prevent a break between syllables, <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span class="uname">U+2060 WORD JOINER</span></span>(WJ) can be used.</p>

<p>It is also important to bear in mind that Khmer may be used to write various languages, in particular minority languages for which different dictionaries are needed. Since such dictionaries may not available in a given browser or other application, there is a tendency to use ZWSP in order to compensate.</p>

<p>Large-scale manual entry of ZWSP and WJ has potential downsides because the user cannot see them; this leads to problems with ZWSP being inserted in the wrong position, or multiple times. However, these don't set a state, so it doesn't create major issues. It would be useful, however, if an editor showed the location of these characters.</p>

<p>Care should also be taken when trying to match text, eg. for searching in a page. WJ should be ignored. ZWSP may or may not be ignored, depending on whether word boundaries are significant for the search.</p>

<h2>Line &amp; paragraph layout</h2>




<section id="h_line_breaking">
<h3>Line breaking &amp; hyphenation</h3>

<p>Although Khmer doesn't use spaces or dividers between words, the expectation is that line-breaks occur at word boundaries.</p>

<p>Because Khmer doesn't separate words, applications typically look up word boundaries in a dictionary, however, such lookup doesn't always produce the needed result, especially when dealing with compound words and proper names (see <a href="#h_words"></a>).</p>

<p>To counteract these deficiencies, authors may use U+200B ZERO WIDTH SPACE and U+2060 WORD JOINER (see <a href="#h_zwsp"></a>).</p>

<p>If a dictionary fails to keep two or more syllables together as needed, it should be possible to use the Unicode character <span class="uname">U+2060 WORD JOINER</span> between the two syllables. This is an invisible character, equivalent to a zero-width no-break space, and used to prevent line-breaks.</p>

<p>Text is not broken at sub-word syllable boundaries. In fact, this is particularly difficult to do algorithmically in Khmer, because syllable-final consonants are indistinguishable from consonants with an inherent vowel that constitute a new syllable. Some kind of morphological analysis is needed.</p>
</section>






<section id="h_alignment">
<h3>Text alignment &amp; justification</h3>

<p>Justification in Khmer adjusts blank spaces, but also makes certain adjustments to inter-character spacing.</p>
</section>







<section id="h_spacing">
<h3>Text spacing</h3>
<p>Cambodian text doesn't appear to use inter-letter spacing in running text, however it is sometimes used in signage. (<a href="https://github.com/w3c/sealreq/issues/9#issuecomment-387971659">@mcdurdin)</a> See an <a href="https://www.phnompenhpost.com/post-property/impasse-tbong-khmum-over-who-starts-building-first">example</a>.</p>
<p>The rules for where the separations appear are still not clear, however one might expect that it keeps together base + subjoined consonants, and base consonants + vowel signs.</p>
<p>The situation is less clear for spacing vowel-signs such as <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="km">◌ា</span> [<span class="uname">U+17B6 KHMER VOWEL SIGN AA​</span>]</span>, which are shown separated in the example linked to above.</p>

<section id="h_counters">
<h3>Counters, lists, etc.</h3>

<p>Counters are used to number lists, chapter headings, etc.</p>
<p>Khmer uses two counter styles:</p>
<ol>
<li>a numeric style, and</li>
<li>an alphabetic style.</li>
</ol>
<p>The numeric style uses the Khmer digits '០' '១' '២' '៣' '៤' '៥' '៦' '៧' '៨' '៩' in a decimal pattern.</p>
<div class="figwrap">
<figure id="numeric_counter_style">
<p class="large">1&nbsp;⇨&nbsp;<span class="ex">១</span> 2&nbsp;⇨&nbsp;<span class="ex">២</span> 3&nbsp;⇨&nbsp;<span class="ex">៣</span> 4&nbsp;⇨&nbsp;<span class="ex">៤</span><br>

<figcaption>Examples of counter values using the Khmer numeric counter style.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>The alphabetic style uses the following letters, in the order shown: 'ក' 'ខ' 'គ' 'ឃ' 'ង' 'ច' 'ឆ' 'ជ' 'ឈ' 'ញ' 'ដ' 'ឋ' 'ឌ'
'ឍ' 'ណ' 'ត' 'ថ' 'ទ' 'ធ' 'ន' 'ប' 'ផ' 'ព' 'ភ' 'ម' 'យ' 'រ' 'ល' 'វ'
'ស' 'ហ' 'ឡ' 'អ'.</p>
<div class="figwrap">
<figure id="numeric_counter_style2">
<p class="large">1&nbsp;⇨&nbsp;<span class="ex" lang="km">ក</span> 2&nbsp;⇨&nbsp;<span class="ex">ខ</span> 3&nbsp;⇨&nbsp;<span class="ex">គ</span> 4&nbsp;⇨&nbsp;<span class="ex">ឃ</span><br>
