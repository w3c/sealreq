    <p>This document describes requirements for the layout and presentation of text in languages that use the Lao script when they are used by Web standards and technologies, such as HTML, CSS, Mobile Web, Digital Publications, and Unicode.</p>

    <p>This document describes the basic requirements for Lao script layout and text support on the Web and in eBooks. These requirements provide information for Web technologies such as CSS, HTML and digital publications about how to support users of Lao scripts. Currently the document focuses on Lao as used for the Lao language. The information here is developed in conjunction with a <a href="../gap-analysis/laoo-gap.html">document that summarises gaps</a> in support on the Web for Lao.</p>
	
	<p>The editor's draft of this document is being developed by the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/sealreq/">Southeast Asian Layout Task Force</a>, part of the W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/ig/">Internationalization Interest Group</a>. It is published by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/core/">Internationalization Working Group</a>. The end target for this document is a Working Group Note.</p>

  <h3>Gap analysis</h3>

    <p>This document is pointed to by a separate document, <a href="../gap-analysis/laoo-gap.html">Lao Gap Analysis</a>, which describes gaps in support for Lao on the Web, and prioritises and describes the impact of those gaps on the user.</p>
<p>Wherever an unsupported feature is indentified through the gap analysis process, the requirements for that feature need to be documented. This document is where those requirements are described.</p>
<p>This document should contain no reference to a particular technology. For example, it should not say &quot;CSS does/doesn't do such and such&quot;, and it should not describe how a technology, such as CSS, should implement the requirements. It is technology agnostic, so that it will be evergreen, and it simply describes how the script works. The gap analysis document is the appropriate place for all kinds of technology-specific information.</p>

  <h3>Other related resources</h3>

    <p>The document <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/typography/">Language enablement index</a> points to this document and others, and provides a central location for developers and implementers to find information related to various scripts.</p>
<p>The W3C also maintains a tracking system that has links to github issues in W3C repositories. There are separate links for (a) requests from developers to the user community for information about how scripts/languages work, (b) issues raised against a spec, and (c) browser bugs. For example, you can find out <a href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=type-info-request">what information developers are currently seeking</a>, and the resulting list can also be filtered by script.</p>

<section id="h_script_overview">
  <h2>Lao Script Overview</h2>
    <p>Lao is an alphabet. This means that it is phonetic in nature, where each letter represents a basic sound.</p>
<p>The script was originally an <span class="newterm"><a class="termref" href="https://www.unicode.org/glossary/#abugida">abugida</a></span>, but since the script reforms leading up to 1960 it has been alphabetic. The syllable is the unit for various aspects of the behaviour of the script. Lao is a tonal language, and the script is designed to reflect tonal information.</p>
<p>The alphabet is split into vowels and consonants. The consonants are grouped into classes that affect the default tonal behaviour of a syllable. There are no independent vowels. Where there is no consonant to support a vowel sign, the character ອ [U+0EAD LAO LETTER O] is used as a support. Vowel signs are typically used in combinations to form the vowel sounds of a syllable.</p>
<p>Words are not separated by spaces. Text runs horizontally, left to right.</p>
<p><a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/lao/">Lao script summary</a> can be read for a high level overview of characters used for the script, and some basic features. Text from that the latter part of that page was used for the initial version of this document.</p>

<h2>Line &amp; paragraph layout</h2>

    <section id="h_line_breaking">
      <h3>Line breaking</h3>
<p>Although Lao doesn't use spaces or dividers between words, the expectation is that line-breaks occur at word boundaries.</p>
<p>Unlike Thai or Khmer, it is fairly straightforward to parse individual syllables in Lao, because its alphabetic nature makes it possible to identify syllable-final consonants. (Note that syllable wrapping must include any syllable-initial clusters involving h or l.)</p>
<p>While nearly all syllables can be argued to be words in their own right, there is still a preference for keeping multi-syllabic words (eg. <span lang="lo">ປະເທດ</span> <span class="trans">pa thēt</span> <span class="meaning">country</span>) together when wrapping text to the next line. For this, an application typically needs to use a dictionary to parse Lao text.</p>
<p>However, widely used software automatically inserts ​ <span class="uname">U+200B ZERO WIDTH SPACE</span> (ZWSP) in Lao text at word or syllable boundaries, and many web pages use such inserted ZWSP characters to get browsers to wrap correctly.</p>
<p>If a dictionary fails to keep two or more syllables together as needed, it should be possible to use the Unicode character <span class="uname">U+2060 WORD JOINER</span> between the two syllables. This is an invisible character, equivalent to a zero-width no-break space, and used to prevent line-breaks.</p>
<p><em>Other ideas to consider:</em></p>
<p class="issue">Also &quot;Some writers are beginning to use optional hyphens for syllable boundaries within words, which helps readability at line breaks.&quot; (<a href="https://github.com/w3c/sealreq/issues/3#issuecomment-385837202">@jmdurdin</a>)</p>
<p class="issue">&quot;One other difference from Thai is that European style punctuation (period, comma) is much more widely used in Lao than in Thai, with the consequence that traditional spaced phrase punctuation is now often incorrectly used, with spaces sometimes inserted within words.&quot; (<a href="https://github.com/w3c/sealreq/issues/3#issuecomment-385837202">@jmdurdin</a>)</p>

    <section id="h_counters">
    <h3>Counters</h3>
<p>Counters are used to number lists, chapter headings, etc.</p>
<p>Lao uses a numeric counter style, based on the decimal model, and using the standard Lao digits, '໐' '໑' '໒' '໓' '໔' '໕' '໖' '໗' '໘' '໙' in a decimal pattern.</p>
